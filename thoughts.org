Okay so my code as is lets me see amount of letters and how many letters were found in the text i think it would be cool to print it as is and maybe even sort them alphabetically.
I think when I input them in it I would have to set them to a index. maybe have the alphabet be a set since we know it only gonna be that many.
before we try to sort it alphabetically i think im just gonna try to get it to print out nicely and we will see how it goes from there


okay so right now when im printing i im getting the index so I imagine letter_tracker at i gives me the keypair

okay so print(letter_tracker[i]) does not give me the keyvalue pair but just bricks my code. Why it does this im not too sure I also don't understand dicts in python probably as well as I should.

okay I have now read up and I think I understand it now perchance


okay so now it prints nicely and so now I think I just need to edit my intial for loop to sort it alphabetically

I feel like it would look nicer to get it done in my intial loop but I may be skill gapped to try and do it as is.

So it might be easier to resort it after

so we have our keyval

im not sure how to get a index in my current for values in letter_tracker

I probably need to figure shit out lo

I mean I could maybe loop


maybe we check if when we loop through values in letter_tracker aka our chars we do a if that compares it to our alphabet list and if its the same we set our key value pair to the poistion.




LMAO so I just read the doc for dicts and I see theres a sorted() function that does what I wanted. Im sure their is another way to do what I wanted but for now Im fine with this.
